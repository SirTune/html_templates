		<h2 id="Career">Career Goals</h2>

		<div style="text-indent:25px;">
		<p>
			I’ve had an interested in mathematics due to the daily applications of this field, and the challenges which pushed my problem
			solving ability. In later experiences, I developed a better understanding of mathematics and the numerous applications of this subject,
			gaining insight into the field. Having earned a BSc Business Mathematics in 2014, introduced me to new areas in mathematics, that providing
			me with numerous career opportunities. Progressing through a few years in a working environment allowed me to implement the knowledge from my
			studies which helped me obtain valuable experience, and has also introduced my interest in programming.
			However, I always look to further expand my knowledge which will provide me with an opportunity to pursue a future role in development.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the years I obtained work experiences from a placement year during my degree and after completing my undergraduate, which expanded
			my experience in numerous roles in finance and logistics. These roles allowed me to apply my analytical skills in
			account reconciliation and data analysis duties, as well as many technical skills to optimise areas in the workplace. My primary responsibility
			in my current role as a technical support analyst focuses on the development of macros/sub-routines or MI reports using Visual Basic in order to
			automate process that replicates daily duties and essentially enhancing the process. In addition, I was involved in creating new automated processes
			for current projects in development, and analysing large data to identify discrepancies which provided MI reports to senior level members. This experience
			was valuable as the role lacked any technical support which showed my independence on the job, helped improve my communication by understanding work processes
			for development, and provided me with opportunities to improve my technical knowledge.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the future, I hope to continue a career in programming and development, where I am able to use the knowledge I gained over the years in practice,
			whilst continuing to expanding my range in a number of areas of languages and development.
